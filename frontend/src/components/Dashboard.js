      <h3>Green Hydrogen Production </h3>
      <p className="dash-data">The EU has prioritized hydrogen as a cornerstone of its energy transition, focusing on renewable and low-carbon sources to achieve net-zero emissions and sustainable development. As outlined in the REPowerEU Strategy (2022), the goal is to produce and import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen each by 2030. By 2050, renewable hydrogen is expected to supply approximately 10% of the EU’s energy, driving decarbonisation in energy-intensive industries and the transport sector.

Currently, hydrogen represents less than 2% of Europe’s energy consumption, predominantly used for chemical manufacturing, such as plastics and fertilizers. However, 96% of this hydrogen is derived from natural gas, producing significant CO₂ emissions. Transitioning to renewable hydrogen is critical for mitigating these environmental impacts.

To support this transition, the EU established a comprehensive hydrogen policy framework. Introduced under the ‘Fit for 55’ package (2021), the framework includes binding targets for renewable hydrogen adoption in industry and transport by 2030, enshrined in the revised Renewable Energy Directive (2023). The Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package (2024) further enhances infrastructure and market efficiency for hydrogen deployment.

Complementing this, two delegated acts (2023) define criteria for renewable hydrogen and outline methodologies for calculating life-cycle emissions for renewable and recycled carbon fuels. These measures build upon the EU Hydrogen Strategy (2020), which identifies 20 critical actions across five strategic areas to advance hydrogen technologies and integration.

Hydrogen is poised to play a pivotal role in achieving the EU’s energy transition and decarbonisation objectives.</p>
